    "question": "What’s the difference between front‑load and top‑load washing machines?",
    "answer": "Front‑load washers use a horizontal drum that tumbles clothes, typically clean better, are gentler on fabrics, use less water and energy, but have longer cycles and require door‑seal care. Top‑load washers use a vertical drum with an agitator or impeller, usually have shorter cycles and are easier to load mid‑wash, but use more water and can be rougher on clothes."
