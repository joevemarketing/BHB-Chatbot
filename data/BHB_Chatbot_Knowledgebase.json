    "answer": "Upsell and cross-sell must be helpful, not pushy. 1) Start from the customer's stated budget and needs. 2) Suggest upgraded features only if they solve a real problem, such as inverter air conditioners for heavy users, or larger-capacity washers for big families. 3) Cross-sell related items that are genuinely useful, such as voltage stabilisers or surge protectors. 4) Always disclose if an item is a more premium option and respect the customer's final budget decision."

If real-time inventory is integrated, it may say, for example: 'Currently in stock (last updated today), but availability can change quickly. Would you like us to reserve or confirm via WhatsApp?' If real-time data is not available, the chatbot must avoid promising and instead say: 'Stock availability may vary by outlet and time.

    "answer": "For elderly customers, customers with mobility challenges or families with babies, staff and chatbot should pay attention to safety, ease of use and noise levels. Examples: recommend front-load washers with easy-to-reach doors, quiet air conditioners with sleep modes, or refrigerators with door handles and shelves at reachable heights.

    "answer": "For large appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, TVs and air conditioners, BHB usually offers delivery to addresses within its service areas in Northern Malaysia and selected other regions. Delivery slots are scheduled based on route planning and stock arrival. High-rise deliveries may involve additional charges if there is no lift access, difficult access routes or extra manpower required.

    "question": "How does BHB handle installation for items like air conditioners and water heaters?",
    "answer": "Installation for items that require technical work (such as air conditioners, water heaters, built-in hobs and cooker hoods) is usually performed by authorised third-party installers or manufacturer-approved service partners. BHB staff should: 1) Clearly distinguish between delivery and installation charges. 2) Inform customers if basic installation is included in the price or charged separately. 3) Explain what is included in 'standard installation' (e.g. piping length, wall drilling, brackets) and what counts as additional charges. 4) Never promise complex wiring or renovation work that lies outside the installer’s scope."

    "question": "What are BHB's general principles for returns and refunds?",
    "answer": "As an electrical retailer, BHB follows these general principles: 1) Products must usually be in new, unused condition with original packaging for change-of-mind returns, where such returns are allowed. 2) Dead-on-arrival (DOA) or manufacturing defects within a defined period may be handled via exchange or manufacturer service centre, depending on brand policy. 3) Opened, installed or heavily used items typically follow manufacturer warranty procedures rather than simple refunds. Because each brand and promotion may have different terms, staff and chatbot should provide only high-level guidance and then refer to BHB's official Return & Refund Policy and the specific invoice terms."

    "topic": "warranty_support",
    "question": "How should staff and chatbot explain warranty support?",
    "answer": "All genuine products sold by BHB include official manufacturer warranties. The typical steps are: 1) Customer keeps invoice or e-receipt as proof of purchase. 2) Customer registers warranty online or via warranty card where required. 3) For issues, customer contacts the brand’s authorised service centre or BHB customer service, who can help guide them. Staff must avoid making promises on warranty coverage beyond what the manufacturer states, such as number of years, on-site vs carry-in or compressor-only coverage."

Staff and chatbot must: 1) Avoid asking for unnecessary sensitive information. 2) Never share personal data with unauthorised parties. 3) Use official BHB systems and devices to store or access customer information. 4) Comply with Malaysia's data protection requirements and BHB's internal privacy policy."

    "question": "What is the difference between inverter and non-inverter air conditioners?",
    "answer": "Inverter air conditioners adjust compressor speed according to cooling demand. This makes them more energy-efficient in real usage, quieter and usually more comfortable for long daily use. Non-inverter units turn the compressor fully on or off, which can mean higher electricity bills and more noticeable temperature swings. For bedrooms and living rooms where the aircond is used many hours per day, BHB generally recommends inverter models for long-term savings, subject to customer budget."

    "answer": "Front-load washers typically offer better cleaning performance, are gentler on clothes, more water-efficient and can stack with dryers. They may have longer wash cycles and higher upfront prices. Top-load washers are usually easier to load (no bending), have shorter cycles and sometimes lower prices, but may use more water and be slightly harsher on fabrics. For small condos or laundry corners, a front-load washer with stacking option is often recommended; for older customers who prefer simple loading, a top-load may be more suitable."

    "answer": "BHB should generally advise against using standard domestic extension cords for heavy appliances like air conditioners, water heaters, large refrigerators or washing machines. These appliances should have dedicated wall sockets and wiring sized appropriately. For smaller appliances like fans or table-top devices, a good-quality, surge-protected extension strip may be acceptable if used within its rating. When in doubt, recommend consulting a licensed electrician."

    "answer": "A simple rule: screen size in inches is about 1.5–2 times smaller than the viewing distance in feet. For example, if the sofa is about 8 feet from the TV, a 55–65 inch TV is usually comfortable. For small bedrooms, 40–50 inches may be sufficient. Remind customers that resolution and content quality also affect viewing comfort, and suggest visiting the showroom to stand at the actual distance and see what feels right."

    "question": "What are the chatbot's safety boundaries for technical advice?",
    "answer": "The chatbot may explain general sizing rules, maintenance tips and how to use common features, but it must not guide customers to perform dangerous DIY work that involves internal wiring, refrigerant, plumbing changes or opening sealed units. In such cases it must recommend contacting authorised installers or service centres."

    "question": "When must the chatbot escalate to a human staff member?",
    "answer": "The chatbot should escalate when: 1) A customer is angry, upset or threatening complaints. 2) The enquiry involves order changes, refunds, complex warranty disputes or missing deliveries. 3) The customer asks about custom quotes for projects, bulk purchases or corporate accounts. 4) The customer clearly prefers to talk to a human. The bot should politely collect key details such as name, contact and a brief issue summary and forward them through the appropriate channel."

    "answer": "Example: 'Based on your 140 sq ft bedroom and daily usage, a 1.0 HP inverter air conditioner would be a good fit. Inverter models will help reduce your electricity bill if you use them many hours each day. At BHB, we carry brands like Panasonic, Daikin and Samsung in this range. Would you like a more budget-friendly option, or are you open to mid-range premium models?'"

    "answer": "Example: 'I’m really sorry that your washer is giving you trouble. Let me help. Could you share your invoice number, the model and roughly when you purchased it? I’ll also need a short description of the problem, for example any error code shown or unusual sound. Once I have these details, I can check the warranty status and connect you with our team or the authorised service centre for the next steps.'"

    "topic": "short_answer_policy",
    "question": "How long should normal chatbot answers be?",
    "answer": "Most answers should fit on one mobile screen: a short intro sentence followed by 3–6 bullet points if needed. The bot should only go longer for technical guides or detailed comparisons, and even then it should offer a summary first and ask 'Would you like more details?' before sending long explanations."

    "question": "How should the chatbot respond if the user switches to Bahasa Malaysia?",
    "answer": "If the chatbot supports Bahasa Malaysia, it should switch smoothly, for example: 'Baik, saya akan sambung dalam Bahasa Malaysia ya. Boleh beritahu saya, anda sedang cari barang elektrik apa – contohnya penghawa dingin, peti sejuk atau mesin basuh?' If it does not support that language well, it should apologise politely and continue in the default language while offering human assistance."
